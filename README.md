Easy YouTube Anime creation with ChatGPT/Gemini and other creative AI tools

## Project Objective

This project aims to demonstrate a collaborative approach to anime creation on YouTube using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini, alongside AI-driven music tools. My goal is to show how simple yet charming anime content can be generated by combining text-based guidance from AIs with creative editing tools.

### How This Anime Was Created

- **Character Consistency with AI**:  
  To ensure the cat character remains visually consistent throughout the animation, I asked AIs to generate a YAML description of the cat image. This structured format helps avoid variations when regenerating or editing the character, keeping the animation cohesive.

- **Music Synchronization with AI**:  
  For the dancing moves, the AIs taught me how to create music that matches the cat's choreography. I also requested a music YAML to be submitted to Boomy, allowing the AI music generator to produce sounds perfectly synchronized with the cat's movements.

- **Visual & Audio Editing**:  
  All images and audio were combined in Canva, using simple slides to animate the cat. The final animation was exported as an MP4 video.

### Co-Joint Effort with LLMs

Every step of this project—from character design to music production—was assisted by LLMs. Their ability to generate detailed, structured prompts (like YAML for images and music) made it possible to maintain consistency and synchronize different media elements.

**Example Cat YAML (for consistent character generation):**
```yaml
cat:
  style: "cute, cartoon, white and gray"
  pose: "standing, left paw up, dancing"
  eyes: "big, round, blue"
  accessories: "none"
  background: "transparent"
```

**Example Music YAML (for Boomy):**
```yaml
music:
  bpm: 100
  mood: "playful, bouncy"
  instruments:
    - "synth"
    - "drum machine"
    - "bells"
  structure:
    - "intro: 2 bars"
    - "verse: 8 bars"
    - "chorus: 8 bars"
    - "outro: 2 bars"
  rhythm_sync: "matches cat's dance moves"
```
